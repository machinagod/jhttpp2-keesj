1. Win32 Java2 JRE1.3: If you starts jHTTPp2 BEFORE your internet-connection,
some (??) hosts can not be accessed (Host not found.)
Solution: Connect first to the internet, then start jHTTPp2.
Reason: Should be a bug? in the JRE...
Please write if this bug occurs also on other operating systems (or better: how to avoid this failure!)

jHTTPp2 doesn't work very well with some ISP or web server (with all filters disabled!)
 I didn't locate the problem yet, but I think it's a bug in the header parsing and/or
the connection behaviour (jHTTPp2 keeps the connection always up,
also when the server sent a connection: close header, because jHTTPp2 didn't look at
any server header)
